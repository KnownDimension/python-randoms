### borderline basic math complete

## what is this
this is a basic calculator to do basic math in a arguably poorly layed out gtk app done entirely in python

## what can it do
as of now, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, with error handling, alongside brackets

## why no build uning gtk builder or layout app
wanted to learn abit about how gtk worked before using a layout builder, + i dont like the look of XML
